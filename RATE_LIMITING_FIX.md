# D&D 5e Grimoire Builder - Rate Limiting Fix

This change addresses the 429 "Too Many Requests" error occurring in the production environment by implementing:

## 1. Enhanced Caching System

- Added cache expiration (24 hours)
- Implemented proper error handling for cache operations
- Added timestamp tracking for cached items

## 2. API Request Rate Limiting

- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for rate-limited requests
- Implemented concurrent request limiting (3 requests at a time)
- Added request batching to control API load
- Prevented duplicate in-flight requests to the same endpoint

## 3. User Experience Improvements

- Added meaningful error messages when rate limits occur
- Implemented a retry button for recovery from API errors
- Added loading states that show partial data while waiting for full details
- Added visual feedback for retry attempts

## 4. Performance Optimizations

- Preloaded common API endpoints
- Implemented controlled concurrency
- Added gradual loading of spell details

These changes ensure the application remains usable even when hitting API rate limits and provides users with appropriate feedback during API communication issues.

## Testing Instructions

1. Clear local storage to test from scratch
2. Watch the network tab to observe controlled API requests
3. Use the app normally and verify spells load correctly
4. Deploy to production and confirm rate limiting issues are resolved
