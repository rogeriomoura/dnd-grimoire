# Active Context: D&D 5e Grimoire Builder

## Current Work Focus

The D&D 5e Grimoire Builder has evolved with enhanced functionality. Users can now:

1. View a list of D&D 5e spells fetched from the D&D 5e API
2. Search for spells by name
3. Filter spells by level and school of magic
4. Add spells to their grimoire
5. View detailed spell information in their grimoire
6. Export their grimoire as a PDF
7. Create and manage multiple grimoires
8. Benefit from optimized performance with smart caching

The current focus is on:

- Enhancing the filtering system
- Improving the mobile experience
- Optimizing performance
- Adding character class-based filtering

## Recent Changes (May 20, 2025)

- Enhanced the spell filtering system with level and school filters
- Implemented smart caching for better performance
- Added proper loading states and error handling
- Improved the SpellList component with better metadata display
- Enhanced the user interface with better feedback
- Optimized data fetching and state management
- Added comprehensive TypeScript types

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Further Enhance Search Functionality**

   - Add filtering by character class
   - Consider adding combination filters
   - Add sorting options for spell lists

2. **Improve UI/UX**

   - Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Add animations for state transitions
   - Implement a dark mode theme
   - Add spell favorites system

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement virtual scrolling for large spell lists

   - Consider adding homebrew spell support

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Caching Strategy**

   - Implemented localStorage-based caching for spell data
   - Cache is persistent across sessions
   - No automatic cache clearing to optimize performance

2. **Component Architecture**

   - SpellList component handles all filtering logic
   - Filters implemented with useMemo for performance
   - Loading states managed at component level

3. **Data Management**
   - Spell data fetched with proper error handling
   - School and level data included in initial fetch
   - TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
