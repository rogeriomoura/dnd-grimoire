# Active Context: D&D 5e Grimoire Builder

## Current Work Focus

The D&D 5e Grimoire Builder is currently in its initial development phase. The core functionality has been implemented, allowing users to:

1. View a list of D&D 5e spells fetched from the D&D 5e API
2. Search for spells by name
3. Add spells to their grimoire
4. View detailed spell information in their grimoire
5. Export their grimoire as a PDF

The current focus is on:

- Ensuring the application works correctly with the D&D 5e API
- Improving the user interface and experience
- Enhancing the PDF export functionality
- Adding additional filtering options for spells

## Recent Changes

- Implemented the basic application structure with React and TypeScript
- Created the SpellList component for browsing and searching spells
- Developed the Grimoire component for displaying selected spells
- Implemented the SpellCard component for showing detailed spell information
- Added basic styling with CSS
- Integrated with the D&D 5e API for fetching spell data
- Added PDF export functionality

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Enhance Search Functionality**

   - Add filtering by spell level
   - Add filtering by spell school
   - Add filtering by character class

2. **Improve UI/UX**

   - Implement a more visually appealing design
   - Add loading indicators during API calls
   - Improve responsive design for mobile devices
   - Enhance the print layout

3. **Add Error Handling**

   - Implement better error messages for API failures
   - Add fallback UI for when the API is unavailable
   - Handle edge cases in spell data

4. **Deployment and CI/CD**
   - ✅ Set up GitHub Pages deployment
   - Configure automated deployments on push to main branch
   - Add build status badges to README

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Local Storage Integration**

   - Save grimoire to local storage
   - Allow users to load previously saved grimoires

2. **Multiple Grimoires**

   - Allow users to create and manage multiple grimoires
   - Implement naming and organization features

3. **Export Options**
   - ✅ Add PDF export functionality
   - Implement different export themes

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **API Dependency**

   - The application currently relies entirely on the D&D 5e API
   - Considering adding a fallback data source or caching mechanism
   - Evaluating the need for a backend to proxy API requests

2. **State Management**

   - Currently using React's built-in useState for state management
   - Monitoring complexity to determine if a more robust solution (Context API, Redux) is needed
   - Considering the trade-offs between simplicity and scalability

3. **Styling Approach**

   - Currently using plain CSS files
   - Evaluating the need for a CSS-in-JS solution or a component library
   - Considering the addition of a theming system

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitoring performance as the grimoire grows in size
   - Considering pagination or virtualization for large spell lists
   - Evaluating the impact of multiple API calls on user experience

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Component Organization**

   - Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks when appropriate

2. **TypeScript Usage**

   - Define explicit interfaces for all props and state
   - Use type guards for handling potentially undefined values
   - Leverage TypeScript's utility types for complex type transformations

3. **API Integration**

   - Use async/await for all asynchronous operations
   - Implement consistent error handling patterns
   - Transform API responses to match application data structures

4. **Styling Conventions**
   - Use descriptive class names that reflect component purpose
   - Maintain a consistent naming convention for CSS classes
   - Organize CSS properties in a logical order

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **API Limitations**

   - The D&D 5e API provides comprehensive spell data but has some inconsistencies
   - Some spells have missing fields or unexpected data formats
   - API response times can vary, affecting user experience

2. **User Experience Considerations**

   - Users need immediate feedback when adding spells to their grimoire
   - Search functionality is critical for navigating the large spell list
   - PDF export layout requires special attention to be useful at the gaming table

3. **Technical Insights**

   - React's state management is sufficient for the current application complexity
   - TypeScript provides significant benefits for maintaining code quality
   - The application architecture supports incremental feature additions

4. **Future Directions**
   - User testing indicates interest in character-specific grimoire customization
   - Integration with character sheet applications could provide additional value
   - Mobile-first design would better serve users who reference spells on phones/tablets during gameplay

This active context represents the current state of development and thinking around the D&D 5e Grimoire Builder project. It will be updated as the project evolves and new insights emerge.
