# Progress: D&D 5e Grimoire Builder

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- ✅ Fetching spell list from D&D 5e API
- ✅ Displaying spell list in the UI
- ✅ Searching spells by name
- ✅ Selecting spells to add to grimoire
- ✅ Fetching detailed spell information
- ✅ Displaying spell details in the grimoire
- ✅ Basic print functionality

### Components

- ✅ App component (main application structure)
- ✅ SpellList component (browsing and searching)
- ✅ Grimoire component (displaying selected spells)
- ✅ SpellCard component (displaying spell details)

### UI/UX

- ✅ Basic styling with CSS
- ✅ Responsive layout for desktop
- ✅ Search input for filtering spells
- ✅ Click interaction for selecting spells

## What's Left to Build

### Core Functionality

- ❌ Filtering spells by level
- ❌ Filtering spells by school
- ❌ Filtering spells by class
- ❌ Saving grimoire to local storage
- ❌ Loading grimoire from local storage
- ❌ Managing multiple grimoires
- ❌ Exporting grimoire as PDF

### UI/UX Improvements

- ❌ Enhanced visual design
- ❌ Loading indicators
- ❌ Error messages for API failures
- ❌ Mobile-responsive design improvements
- ❌ Improved print layout
- ❌ Accessibility enhancements
- ❌ Dark mode support

### Technical Improvements

- ❌ Comprehensive error handling
- ❌ Performance optimization for large grimoires
- ❌ Caching mechanism for API responses
- ❌ Unit and integration tests
- ❌ Documentation improvements

## Current Status

The application is in a **functional MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** state. Users can:

1. View and search the complete list of D&D 5e spells
2. Add spells to their grimoire
3. View detailed information about selected spells
4. Print their grimoire

The core functionality works as expected, but there are opportunities for enhancement in terms of features, UI/UX, and technical implementation.

## Known Issues

1. **API Dependency**

   - The application relies entirely on the D&D 5e API
   - If the API is down or slow, the application's functionality is affected
   - No fallback mechanism is currently implemented

2. **UI Limitations**

   - The current UI is functional but basic
   - Limited feedback during loading states
   - Print layout could be improved for better usability

3. **Feature Gaps**

   - Limited search/filter capabilities (name only)
   - No persistence between sessions
   - No way to remove spells from the grimoire once added
   - No way to reorder spells in the grimoire

4. **Technical Debt**
   - Limited error handling
   - No test coverage
   - Potential performance issues with large grimoires

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach (Current)

- Focus on core functionality first
- Simple component structure
- Direct API integration
- Basic styling
- No persistence layer

### Planned Evolution

1. **Phase 1: Enhanced Filtering and UI**

   - Add additional filtering options
   - Improve visual design
   - Add loading and error states
   - Enhance print layout

2. **Phase 2: Persistence and Management**

   - Implement local storage integration
   - Add ability to manage multiple grimoires
   - Allow removing and reordering spells
   - Add export options

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Implement user accounts (if needed)
   - Add custom/homebrew spell support
   - Enhance mobile experience
   - Add spell slot tracking

### Technical Evolution Considerations

- Monitor state management complexity to determine if Context API or Redux is needed
- Evaluate styling approach as UI complexity increases
- Consider adding a backend if features like user accounts are implemented
- Assess performance optimization needs as the application grows
